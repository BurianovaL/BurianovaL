- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn https://cz.linkedin.com/in/lucie-burianová 

Twenty-three-year-old student of data and information management at Masaryk University. Despite my long experience in copywriting, proofreading and a quarter year of work experience in the most read news media in the Czech Republic, my future is more focused on research and analytics, not only the media ones. Currently I am deepening my knowledge in SQL and Python, I am also improving my skills in data and business analytics and Tableau.

I love working with people and children, helping them to develop and learn something new. I'm crazy about skilltoys - I can solve a Rubik's cube in 12 seconds and I'm a vice-champion of the Czech Republic in freestyle yoyoing. If I'm not sitting at the computer or with a guitar in my hand, look for me on the disc golf course or in a good coffee shop.
